## Structure of the course
<!-- Meets twice weekly -->
Most classes will include both a lecture and a collaborative in-class exercise
There will be weekly homework assignments for students to practice that week’s material
There will be a summative final project, in which students will integrate the tools and techniques they have learned into a cohesive whole. 

## Evaluation in the course will be approximately as follows:
- Homeworks: 50%
- Quizzes: 10%
- Final project: 30% 
- Participation: 10%

## Late days
For the homeworks, you will have a total of six (6) late days.  You may use up to two (2) late days per assignment. To use a late day, you need to to message the course staff in a private message on slack, informing us that you will be using a late day.

## Research in the course. 
For this class, we are conducting research on teaching and learning. This research will involve some student work. You will not be asked to do anything above and beyond the normal learning activities and assignments that are part of this course. You are free not to participate in this research, and your participation will have no influence on your grade for this course or your academic career at CMU. If you do not wish to participate, please send an email to Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu). Participants will not receive any compensation. The data collected as part of this research will include student grades. All analyses of data from participants’ coursework will be conducted after the course is over and final grades are submitted. The Eberly Center may provide support on this research project regarding data analysis and interpretation. The Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence & Educational Innovation is located on the CMU-Pittsburgh Campus and its mission is to support the professional development of all CMU instructors regarding teaching and learning. To minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality, the Eberly Center will never have access to data from this course containing your personal identifiers. All data will be analyzed in de-identified form and presented in the aggregate, without any personal identifiers. If you have questions pertaining to your rights as a research participant, or to report concerns to this study, please contact Chad Hershock (hershock@andrew.cmu.edu).

## Professionalism. 
Your classmates are your colleagues. This is particularly true in this course, where we aim to provide you with principles, practices, tools, and paradigms that will enable you to be an effective, real-world Software Engineer. We ask that you treat one another like the professionals you are and that you are preparing to be.
To that end, we will not tolerate harassment in this class. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior of an ad hominem nature, i.e., that focuses not on ideas but on people and identity. This includes offensive verbal or written comments in reference to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Harassment is against the law and we have no tolerance for it, and neither does the university. Even when behavior does not rise to the level of harassment (even if you think you're "just joking!"), it can still make people very uncomfortable, and harm their educational and professional career by forcing them to devote mental energy to something other than the material they are trying to learn or the professional successes they are trying to achieve. However, we expect that we do not need to threaten you to earn your respect on this matter: we simply ask that you treat one another like professionals, in the most positive sense.
This has two implications:
If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), and you feel you have the standing to do so, speak up! Do not be a bystander to unprofessional behavior.
If you do not feel comfortable doing so, and/or if the behavior persists, send a private email to the course instructors or set up a meeting with us to discuss the matter. We will preserve your anonymity.
We, the course staff, are committed to affording you the same respect we ask you to afford one another. If you feel that we are not doing so, we hope you will feel comfortable either telling us so directly, or approaching another one of the course staff with your concerns.
(Thank you to Shriram Krishnamurthi and Evan Peck for sharing their own policies, from which we drew inspiration for this one.)

## Academic honesty and collaboration. 
The usual policies apply, especially the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Many of the assignments will be done in groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that groups work independently from one another, not exchanging results with other groups. Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team. Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honestly and collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of "group."
The course includes both individual assignments and individual components of group assignments. Although your solutions for individual parts will be based on the content produced for the group component (e.g., written reflections on lessons learned), we treat individual components of group assignments as equivalent to individual assignments overall, and expect you to complete such components independently of your groupmates.
You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it.
Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate:
Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications.
Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution.
Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources.
Lying to course staff.
Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts!
Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.
If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. 
It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments, lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code.
Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on Academic Integrity).
If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors for clarification.
Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations.

## Accommodations. 
If you wish to request an accommodation due to a documented disability, please inform the instructor as soon as possible and contact Disability Resources at 412.268.2013 or access@andrew.cmu.edu.

## A note on self care. 
Please take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.











            <h3> Course Overview </h3>

<p>In this course, we will teach you the engineering skills necessary to succeed in
the highly-uncertain environment associated with a technology startup.  Our
focus in this class is technical; that is, we will not be spending very much
time on the business side of the startup equation (though given how much
business drives engineering goals, of course we will not completely ignore it!).
If you are instead interested in the entrepreneurship side of the equation, we
encourage you to consider 15-390, Entrepreneurship for Computer Scientists.

<p>This class will consist of:
<ol>
<li> Lectures. Lectures will cover technical content, and be delivered by the
  professors or other instructors.  </li>
<li>Guest lectures and panels. We will hear from from practicing software
  engineers, technical and non-technical startup cofounders, and other
  individuals with practical expertise. </li>
<li>Recitation. TAs will lead recitation, which consists of activities designed
  to help you apply your knowledge practically and prepare for the
  homework. </li>
<li>Homework assignments. For the first half of the course, you will practice
  the skills we learn in class by working on in assigned teams on a made-up
  startup, "Dronuts." Most of this work will be structured as a series of
  agile-style sprints, to simulate as much as possible the real startup
  experience.</li>
<li>A project. For the second half of the course, you will use your new skills
  to design and implement an original startup idea.  Don’t worry if you don't
  have one; we'll help you to develop a new idea, or connect founders who have
  startup ideas to co-founders who are excited to help with them.  </li>
</ol></p>

<p>There will be one midterm exam.  There will be no final exam; instead, you will
present your final project.</p>

<h3> Grading </h3>

Evaluation will be based on the following approximate distribution: 50%
assignments, 20% midterm, 20% final project, 10% participation.

<p><i>Note:</i> Attendance is required for guest lectures. Absences during guest
lectures will result in a deduction in your overall course grade for
participation.</p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3>

<p><b>Teamwork:</b></p> Teamwork is an essential part of this course. Teams of 3-5 students
will be assigned by the instructors and stay together for multiple
assignments. Most assignments have a component that is graded for the entire
group and a component that is graded individually. By default, group assignments
will receive a single grade, for all individuals.  However, we reserve the right
to institute peer grading in problematic situations, detailed in the  Team
  Policy.</p>

<p>Please fill out the <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PIu_sd9cA9UX2vSZ0VwGurQshoR0ZzY36kxD-HsmMAY/edit">Teamwork
Survey</a> so we can begin forming groups.</p>

<p><b>Late work:</b> Late work will receive feedback but no credit. Due to the course's
heavy reliance on teamwork, there are no late days. We make exceptions in
extraordinary circumstances, typically involving either a family or medical
emergency (ideally, your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs should
request such exceptions on your behalf). We can make accommodations for travel
(e.g., for interviews) so long as you request it <i>in advance</i>.  Always
communicate with your team about such issues. </p>

<p><b>Devices in lecture and recitation:</b> Research shows that using devices
on non-class related activities harms both the device user's learning, and other
students' learning as well.  Therefore, in general, we do not allow the use of
devices during lecture. <i>However,</i>, if you genuinely use your laptop for
class-related activities (note-taking, etc), tell us, and we will make an
exception.  However, we ask that if you do so, you are careful to keep your
devices in note-taking mode (and don’t stray to Facebook, homework, etc).  </p>

<p>Note that recitation activities will often involve devices, so please do bring
your laptop!</p>

<p><b>Time management:</b> This is a 12-unit course.  It is our intention to manage it so
that you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In general, 4
hours/week will be spent in class and recitation, and 8 hours on assignments. A
key challenge in startup engineering is that there is never enough time to
implement everything that you want to implement; it is therefore important that
you practice time management, estimation, and task prioritization.  We would
rather you make well-justified decisions to not do something than spend tens of
hours on your homework.  </p>

<p>Note that most homework is done in groups, so please account for the overhead
and decreased time flexibility that entails. </p>

<p>Feel free to give the course staff feedback on how much time the course is
taking for you.  This is especially relevant as we teach this course for the
first time! </p>

<p><b>Writing:</b> Describing tradeoffs, justifying decisions, and communicating
effectively with less technical stakeholders are key learning goals of this
course. Most homework assignments have a component that require discussing
issues in written form or reflecting about experiences. The <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/gcc/workshops/index.html">Global
Communications Center (GCC)</a> offers one-on-one writing help for students, along
with workshops. The instructors are also happy to provide additional guidance if
requested. </p>

<p><b>Academic honesty and collaboration:</b>
The <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">University
Policy on Academic Integrity</a> applies. Most assignments are done in groups.
Our expectations regarding academic honesty and collaboration for group work are
the same as for individual work, elevated to the level of "group." Group members
will collaborate with one another, but groups should work independently from one
another, not exchanging code with other groups. Within groups, we expect that
you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not
taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not
contributed to the team. </p>

<p>The course also includes individual assignments and individual components of
group assignments. Although your solutions for individual parts may be based on
the content produced for the group component (e.g., written reflections), we
expect you to complete individual components independently of your groupmates. <p>

<p>Regarding the internet, StackOverflow, and similar sources: In real-world
development, engineers often adapt code from Q&A sites, open source
repositories, or similar sources to new ends.  This is acceptable in this
course, with two caveats:


<ol>
<li>You may not copy a solution for our homework assignments specifically from
another student or group, even if, for some reason, that code is available
openly on GitHub or elsewhere (see below on the importance of keeping your
homework code). </li>
<li>You must test all of your code, and those tests must pass.  That is, you must
understand any code you adapt from the internet, and you must demonstrate that
understanding using unit tests.   </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Regarding solutions from other students in the course, we reuse the
  <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/2017-fall/syllabus.html">Collaboration
  Policy from 15-214</a>, with minor modifications: </p>

<i>
<p>"You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by
another student, or was developed together with another student.  You may not
look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may

<!-- Team Policy -->
<li>
  <div class="uk-container uk-container-small uk-margin-top">

<h1>Teamwork Policy</h1>

<p>Working effectively in a group is a critical skill in modern software
  engineering, both in the startup context and generally.  Group work can be
  hard, and not all teams succeed, and in fact a major contributing factor to
  startup failure is team breakdown. The educational context adds its own
  complexities: team members sometimes cannot prepare for or attend group
  sessions because of other responsibilities, and conflicts can result from
  personalities, differing skill levels, work ethics, working styles. </p>

<p>We encourage the following practices to ensure successful group work:
<ul>
<li>Agree on a protocol for meeting and communication.  Some, but not all, of
  these decisions will be technical (Slack? Trello?) that arise naturally over
  startup development. </li>
<li>In the startup context, engineers must be flexible and capable of filling
  many technical roles.  In an educational context, however, group work is most
  successful when groups designate clear roles, such as coordinator, scribe,
  monitor, and checker for each assignment. Agree on roles at the beginning of
  each assignment. Rotate these roles for each assignment to ensure
  fairness. </li>
<li>Agree on meeting times and what each member should have done before the
  meeting (readings, development, writing, taking the first cut at some or all
  of the assigned work, etc.). The <b>scribe</b> documents the agreed tasks and
  deadlines and communicates them to everybody. Not objecting to the
  communicated protocol constitutes acceptance. Make agreements visible to every
  team member, with transparent history of the log.</li>
<li>The <b>coordinator</b> checks with other team members before the meeting to
  remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are supposed to
  do. Team members notify the coordinator in advance if they cannot attend a
  meeting or are in danger of not making a deadline.</li>
<li>All individuals perform the required individual preparation before the
  meeting</li>
<li>During meetings/work times, the <b>coordinator</b> sets  the agenda, and
  keeps everyone on task; the <b>monitor</b> ensures everyone understands both
  the solution and the strategy used to get it, and watches the time to ensure
  meetings stays within the agreed timeslot; and the <b>checker</b> double-checks the
  result before it is handed in, and submits it (or clearly delegates its
  submission, if the checker is unable to do so on time).</li>
<li>At the end of each meeting, agree on the next meeting time and responsibilities. </li>
<li>Review returned assignments together. Make sure everyone understands why
  points were lost and how to correct errors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Preventing and dealing with problems.</b> We encourage you to communicate
  openly with your teammates, which is often enough to help resolve many types
  of team challenges. Clearly documenting agreed-upon tasks and deadlines (see
  scribe role above) and tracking invested time helps in identifying
  issues. Renegotiate agreements when estimated time does not align with
  actually required time and imbalances arise. Document where agreements were
  not honored (what and when, and possibly why). Identify a fallback strategy,
  ideally in agreement with the team member who failed the agreement. In severe
  cases, identify how other team members can take over those tasks. </p>

<p>If a team member does not contribute to an assignment solution, their name
  should not be included on the completed work.</p>

<p>If the problem persists and cannot be solved within the team, the team should
  meet with the instructors so that the problem can be resolved, if possible. If
  problems continue, the cooperating team members may notify the uncooperative
  member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired, sending a copy of
  the memo to the instructor. If there is no subsequent improvement, they should
  notify the individual in writing (copy to the instructor) that he/she is no
  longer with the team. The fired student should meet with the instructors to
  discuss options, such as finding another team willing to add them as a member,
  completing the work alone, or getting zeroes for the remaining
  assignments.</p>

<p>Consult with your instructors if a conflict arises that can't be worked
  through by the team. </p>
