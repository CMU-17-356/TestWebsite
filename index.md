## Course Description
Startup engineering is critical to innovation. The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products; prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments; and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external non-technical stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers.



## Logistics and Communication
Lectures: 10:10 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. Starting semester on Zoom, hopefully to resume in-person if possible.

### Recitations:

Tue @ 12:20 p.m. - 01:10 p.m. (Session A) online via Zoom to start semester

Tue @ 02:30 p.m. - 03:20 p.m. (Session B) online via Zoom to start semester

## Waitlist: 
The waitlist is currently long. We are trying our best to add as many people as possible, but are dealing with limitations imposed by the university. 

## Prerequisites: 
15-214/17-214 or 15-213, or equivalent. The focus of this class is largely technical; the goal of the prerequisites is to ensure students should sufficient programming experience to succeed in the course.

## Textbook/Readings: 
The subject matter of this class is at the cutting edge of engineering; as such, there do not exist (to our knowledge, at least) suitable textbooks covering the material. We will instead pull various readings throughout the semester from online sources.

## Communication: 
The course uses Canvas for homework submission, grading, announcements, and supplementary documents. Discussion and questions will be managed on Slack. Slides, assignments, and schedule will be posted on this website. We use GitHub to coordinate group work. We will provide private GitHub repositories for individuals and groups.

Please use Slack for discussion and questions, including clarifying homework assignments.

The instructors and TAs hold weekly office hours. If you cannot make it to office hours, contact us via email (using the course-wide email address, unless the issue is sensitive) and we will find an alternative time to meet.

If you have a question or concern that is not suitable for Slack, contact the instructors via: startups-staff@lists.andrew.cmu.edu. Unless the subject matter is sensitive, all questions will be conveyed to all instructors before being answered, so there's no point in emailing just one of us.

Note that the list should be set to accept messages from any CMU email address; if your message is held as a non-member posting to a members list, donâ€™t worry: we respond to moderation requests very quickly.

For sensitive matters, of course, feel free to contact us individually.
